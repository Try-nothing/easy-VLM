# 🚀 easy-VLM Project: Lightweight Visual-Language Model Implementation & Exploration

## 🌟 Project Positioning
**easy-VLM** is an open-source initiative focused on reproducing a lightweight visual-language model (VLM). The core objective is to gain a **systematic understanding of mainstream LLM technologies** through hands-on implementation.

📌 **Codebase Origin**: Reproduction of the minimind-V project  
📌 **Key Enhancements**: Added Chinese code annotations + Integrated personal technical insights

## 🧠 Core Technologies Covered
| Module Category         | Key Technical Components                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Foundation Architecture** | Transformer attention, RMSNorm, <br>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), KV caching, RoPE positional encoding |
| **Model Training**      | Pre-training, <br>Instruction fine-tuning         |
| **Multimodal Fusion**   | Visual encoder tokenization → <br>Cross-modal injection into LLM |

## ⚙️ Training & Deployment
- **Hardware Requirement**: Compatible with RTX 4060Ti 8GB GPU
- **Critical Configuration**: Requires parameter adjustment for VRAM constraints
- **Performance Notice**: ⚠️ Significant performance drop when training MoE variants

> **Research Value**: This lightweight implementation provides developers with a **low-cost pathway to practice multimodal technologies**, particularly suitable for foundational learning and deep-diving into LLM principles.
